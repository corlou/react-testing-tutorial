## Credits

A big thank you to Lama Dev on YouTube for this amazing testing tutorial.

[Tutorial found here:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Flo268xRpV0)

I initially downloaded [the repo from here](https://github.com/safak/youtube2022/tree/react-testing), deleted the Login.test file, and followed along. This is because my goal was to learn how to write effective unit tests rather than set up a React project and create a component.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
